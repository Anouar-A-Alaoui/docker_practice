[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a groundbreaking open-source project that has fully unleashed the power of computing virtualization, greatly improving the maintenance efficiency of applications and reducing the cost of cloud computing application development! With Docker, the deployment, testing, and distribution of applications become unprecedentedly efficient and easy!

It is essential for application developers, operations staff, and other IT professionals to understand and master Docker to save precious time.

This book is suitable for Docker beginners who have basic Linux knowledge, as well as advanced users who wish to understand the principles and implementations. The practical examples provided in the book can be referenced during actual deployments. The first six chapters cover the basic concepts and operations of Docker; chapters 7 to 9 introduce advanced operations including data management and networking; chapters 10 to 12 discuss several core projects in the container ecosystem; chapters 13 and 14 discuss advanced topics such as Docker security and implementation technologies. Subsequent chapters introduce related popular open-source projects including Etcd, Fedora CoreOS, Kubernetes, and container clouds. Finally, typical application scenarios and practical cases using container technology are presented.
